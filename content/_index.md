        At the PKU Alignment and Interaction Research Lab (PAIR Lab), we address the fundamental challenges in decision-making, strategic interactions, and value alignment within AGI. Our expertise encompasses reinforcement learning for refined decision-making, multi-agent systems and game theory for complex interactions, and RLHF techniques for secure AGI-human value alignment. Our integrative methodology aims to guide AGI development towards a safe, beneficial future in synchrony with humanity."
